# Hypereal2OpenVR
dynamic library which convert OpenVR call to Hypereal api call
This code is inspired from [Relativty Driver](https://github.com/relativty/Relativty) and code simple from nolo(controller part for nolo cv1). I combined them, removed unnecessary parts and almost fully rewrited the functions&calls.
