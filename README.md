# Hypereal2OpenVR
dynamic library which convert OpenVR call to Hypereal api call

This code is inspired from [Relativty Driver](https://github.com/relativty/Relativty) and nolo code simple (controller part for nolo cv1).

I combined them, removed unnecessary parts and almost fully rewrited the functions&calls.

PS: you can download hypereal pc sdk from Bugzilla for Firefox:https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1378630&attachment=8883821

Thaanks to firefox, it made this driver possible.
